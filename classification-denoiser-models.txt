CLASSIFICATION OF DENOISER MODELS:
Denoiser models can be broadly classified into several categories based on their underlying techniques:

1. Traditional Filters
These are non-learning-based methods that rely on mathematical transformations.

1.1. Linear Filters:
- Gaussian Filter: Smoothing filter that reduces noise by averaging pixel values. In other terms, it blurs the image to reduce high-frequency noise.
- Mean Filter: Similar to Gaussian, but uses a uniform kernel.
- Median Filter: Replaces each pixel with the median value of its neighbourhood, effective for removing salt-and-pepper noise.
1.2. Non-Linear Filters:
- Bilateral Filter: Preserves edges while reducing noise by considering both spatial and intensity differences.
- Wiener Filter: Statistical filter that requires knowledge of the noise and signal power spectra.

2. Wavelet-Based Methods

2.1. Wavelet Transform: Decomposes an image into different frequency bands, allowing for selective noise removal. Example: Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).
2.2. Thresholding: Removes noise coefficients below a certain threshold in the wavelet domain.
- Hard Thresholding: Zeroes out coefficients below a threshold.
- Soft Thresholding: Shrinks coefficients toward zero for smoother results.
2.3. Shrinkage: Reduces the magnitude of noise coefficients, often using soft or hard thresholding. Example: SureShrink, VisuShrink.

3. Deep Learning Models

3.1. Autoencoders: Learn to reconstruct clean images from noisy inputs. Example: DAE (Denoising Autoencoders).
3.2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
- DnCNN: Deep CNN for image denoising, specifically designed for Gaussian noise.
- RIDNet: Residual channel attention network designed for real-world noise. (different noise types)
- FFDNet: Fast and flexible denoising CNN with adjustable noise levels.

3.3. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):
Train a generator to produce clean images and a discriminator to distinguish between real and fake images.
Example: Noise2Void GAN, DeblurGAN.

3.4. Diffusion Models:
Gradually add noise to an image and then learn to reverse the process, effectively removing noise.
Example: Stable Diffusion for Image Restoration.

3.5. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
Sequential models effective for video denoising or handling temporal noise in dynamic image sequences.
Example: ReNet, which processes images in sequential patches, or RNN variants for denoising temporal video frames.

3.6. Transformer-based models: Utilize self-attention mechanisms to model long-range dependencies and adaptively focus on relevant regions for noise removal.
- SwinIR (Swin Transformer): Leverages hierarchical attention with shifted windows to balance global and local context.
- Restormer: Combines self-attention with channel-wise mechanisms for efficient denoising and restoration.

4. Pretrained Models

4.1. Noise2Noise: Leverages pairs of noisy images to train a denoiser without clean ground truth data. Example: TensorFlow implementation
4.2. Real-World Denoising Models: Trained on real-world noisy images to handle complex noise patterns.
- CBDNet: Handles complex, real-world noise patterns.
- SwinIR: Transformer-based model effective for low-light and multi-modal noise.

5. Hybrid and Optimization-Based Approaches
Combine traditional techniques with learning-based methods for enhanced performance.

5.1. Optimization-Based: 
- Total Variation (TV) Minimization: Removes noise by minimizing total variation in the image.
5.2. Hybrid Methods: Combine wavelet-based denoising with deep learning models.
Example: Wavelet CNN (WCNN).
