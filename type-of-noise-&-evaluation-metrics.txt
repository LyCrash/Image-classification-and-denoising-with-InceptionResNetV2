TYPES OF NOISE:
Hereâ€™s a concise summary for each type of noise:

* Gaussian Noise: Fine grain that randomly varies pixel intensity, common in low-light images.  
* Salt-and-Pepper Noise: Sharp black and white dots scattered randomly across the image.  
* Speckle Noise: Grainy patterns that appear in smooth regions, often in radar or medical images.  
* Poisson Noise: Random brightness fluctuations, most noticeable in low-light areas.  
* Uniform Noise: Consistent grain across the image with equal probability for all intensity changes.  
* Periodic Noise: Regular, repetitive patterns like stripes or waves caused by interference.  
* Impulse Noise: Sporadic, extreme-intensity pixels that disrupt the image.  
* Quantization Noise: Banding artifacts in gradients due to limited precision in digital representation.  
* Chromatic Noise: Random colour speckles in uniform colour regions, distorting natural tones.  
* Banding Noise: Horizontal or vertical stripes, often subtle but systematic in appearance.  
* Compression Artifacts: Blocky patterns and loss of detail due to lossy compression (e.g., JPEG).  
* Motion Blur Noise: Streaking of objects from relative motion during exposure.  
* Thermal Noise: Random intensity variations caused by sensor heat, prominent in long exposures.  
* Flicker Noise: Temporal brightness changes across sequential frames, visible in video.  
* Fixed-Pattern Noise: Static patterns in specific areas due to sensor defects or aging.  





EVALUATION METRICS:
Image denoising is a critical task in image processing, aimed at recovering clean images from noisy ones. The performance of denoising models is evaluated using the following metrics:

- PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio): Measures the ratio between the maximum possible signal value and the noise. Higher values indicate better denoising.
- SSIM (Structural Similarity Index): Assesses perceived image quality by comparing structural information between the denoised and reference images.
- MSE (Mean Squared Error): Measures the average squared difference between the original and denoised images. Lower values indicate better performance.
